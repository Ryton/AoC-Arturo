An attempt by a coding enthusiast, by no means a capable or professional one,
to solve the Advent of code puzzles using Arturo programming language.

Some of the event years (appearently the ODD years)  i only / mostly use Arturo. 
Several other editions on EVEN years i solved partially using mostly python, those mischievous attempts can be found in a separate repo.


Disclaimer:
- Expect horribly unclear and inefficient code, that might only work for a minority of cases!
- Feel free to provide constructive feedback if you see improvement optionsvin my code.
- Above all, i would encourage you to join in as well (in coding, Arturo and/or AoC). Because it is a learning experience, but above all: an exciting rollercoaster
